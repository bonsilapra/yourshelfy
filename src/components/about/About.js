                        My name is Asia and I am learning programming. Having completed my studies in Civil Engineering at the Pozna≈Ñ University of Technology and after working in my profession for several years, I decided to change the industry. This is my second project that I made using the React.js library. This website was created mainly to practice using React Redux.

                        The creation of this website would not be possible without the help of my brother - Kuba. He spent a lot of his time teaching me the basics of programming and creating the back-end necessary for this site to function.
